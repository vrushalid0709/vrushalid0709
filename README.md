## Hi, I’m Vrushali 👋  

🎓 **Computer Science Undergrad (3rd Year)**  
🧠 **Background:** Backend Development  
🔍 **Current Focus:** Applied Machine Learning & Data-Driven Systems  

I have worked on backend-focused projects and full-stack applications, and I’m now transitioning toward AI/ML with an interest in how data, systems, and models come together to make reliable decisions.
